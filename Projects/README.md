* [Final Project](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Visualizations/tree/main/Projects/Final_Project)

The main focus of the Final Visualization Project is to create visualizations that focus on the rising cost of undergraduate tuition in the United States. Specifically, we centered our exploration on school spending patterns and student outcomes. As such, the intended audience of this webpage are parents of high school students as well as researchers in understanding the relationship between tuition increase and student impact. This was accomplished with Tableau. The charts answer data-driven questions using public datasets.

*All of these projects were completed for UCB's Master of Data Science Course W209 - Data Visualization. These were completed using Tableau.*
