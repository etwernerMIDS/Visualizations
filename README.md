Data engineering is the aspect of data science that focuses on practical applications of data collection and analysis. Before a company can optimize the business more efficiently or build data products more intelligently, layers of foundational work need to be built first. Data engineering must source, transform, and analyze data from each system. As a result, data engineering helps make data more useful and accessible for consumers of data.

The [projects](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Engineering/tree/master/Projects) in this repository will cover the different aspects within the Data Engineering ETL pipeline, such as 

* **writing** events to *Kafka* topics
* **filtering & separating** events with *Spark*
* **storing** events in *Hadoop* (HDFS)
* **querying** events with *SQL*
