# Visualizations

## Erin Werner

Data visualization provides a clear idea of what the information means by giving it visual context through maps or graphs. This makes the data more natural for the human mind to comprehend and therefore makes it easier to identify trends, patterns, and outliers within large data sets

The [projects](https://github.com/etwernerMIDS/Data_Engineering/tree/master/Projects) in this repository will cover the different aspects within the Data Engineering ETL pipeline, such as 

* **writing** events to *Kafka* topics
* **filtering & separating** events with *Spark*
* **storing** events in *Hadoop* (HDFS)
* **querying** events with *SQL*
